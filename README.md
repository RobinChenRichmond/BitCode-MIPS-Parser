# BitCode-MIPS-Parser

This program reads a file with 32-bits codes, checks that all the codes are in good format, and then converts them into MIPS assembly instructions.
The program contains four classes: Opcode, BitCodeParser, Instruction, RegisterTable; one main file: BitCode.cpp; one Makefile; three tester files: inst.mach, test_file1.mach, test_file2.mach.
